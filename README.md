# fbla-school-manager-app
app to manage students!!! (..why is there cracker code in here?)

## what
project for fbla 2022 coder challenge or whatever. basically its an app written in rust that manages a database of students and can assign them stuff. uses arbitrary sql backends to store student data (sqlite backend rn) with diesel for rust interop and schemas. gui is built in eframe egui, multithreading off tokio, and cross thread communication using crossbeam. uses reqwest to communicate with the Whop api for authentication.. and more.. because at some point i started using this project to write a password cracker that i was going to sell, but got moral pains and decided to stop. compiles down to an executable!

## wha happeb
i wrote this entire program the night of the challenge, didn't finish it, stayed up until 4 am and slept through the 7 am drive up to the competition lol
